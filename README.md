# ATSRecruiter
Project created by my friend Ali Imran and he tested the source control of git

Project may not be in a good code shape as he is learning the Asp.Net mvc and Entity framework

In the Web Config of the Myrecruitinagent project go in webconfig and search ATSEntities change the connection string to your sql instance of db 

you can find the database file backup on the front names ATS.bak restore it on the sql server and enjoy
